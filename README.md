# Project Stingray

This is a face-tracking autonomous foam-missile launcher. It aims for your eyes - you have been warned! 

## Acknowledgements

There are many similar projects out there - here are a few that I found interesting. This project has been heavily influenced by these.

* [Basic motion detection and tracking with Python and OpenCV](http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/05/25/basic-motion-detection-and-tracking-with-python-and-opencv/)

## Parts

* [Raspberry Pi 2](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/)
* [Thunder USB Missile Launcher](http://dreamcheeky.com/thunder-missile-launcher)
* USB Hub (since the missile launcher draws more current than the Raspberry USB ports can supply.)
